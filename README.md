# SSE calculator for non-linear function regressions

## Overview

A SSE calculator to calculate the Sum Squared Error to evaluate the effectiveness of a non-linear regression.
I created this for my Unit 3 Mathematical Methods assignment to evaulate the effectiveness of a surge function's modelling of data.
The `C` and `t` variables represent the Concentration and Time data respectively.
